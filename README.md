Float through a vibrant, generative sky of fractal clouds and balance your glider through a neon dreamworld.
Explore a hypnotic blend of art and motion where every sky is uniquely formed.

## Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fractal Flight is a minimalist flight experience created for the Gamedev.js Jam 2025 under the theme Balance.
You pilot a paraglider across a procedurally generated fractal sky, balancing your movement through shifting psychedelic clouds above a glowing neon cityscape.

🧩 Features

    🪂 Simple paraglider physics with relaxing controls

    🌈 Generative fractal skies—different every time you play

    🏙️ Futuristic neon city as a scrolling background

    🖌️ Psychedelic visuals and color transitions

    🎮 Lightweight and web-based—just click to play

🎮 Gameplay
Use the arrow keys or WASD to gently glide left, right, up, and down.
The goal is to maintain your flight path through visually chaotic skies—don’t get overwhelmed by the beauty!

### Controls:

| Key   | Action      |
| ----- | ----------- |
| ↑ / W | Glide Up    |
| ↓ / S | Glide Down  |
| ← / A | Turn Left   |

⚙️ How It Works

    Glider Mechanics: A simple physics loop mimics gliding through the air using Three.js vector math.

    Fractal Sky: Procedurally rendered with fragment shaders or generated noise to build complex skies.

    City Background: A parallax scrolling image and shapes add depth beneath the clouds.

    Color Shifts: The sky colors pulse and flow using time-based hue shifts.
